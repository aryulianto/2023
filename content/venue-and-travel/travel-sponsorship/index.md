description: In case you don't have enough budget to attend event in-person

Participating UbuCon Asia in-person would require a lot of budget mainly due to flights and accomodations.
In many cases, You may ask your employer, school or other organization to cover expenses for trip to Seoul.
If you have enough money to spend, You can also consider travel to Seoul with your own expenses.
But not everyone would be able to get expenses covered in these ways. For those who who has difficulty with bring travel budget, we have some information for that.
